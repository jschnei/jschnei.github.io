== About me
Hello! I recently obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Princeton University under the supervision of Prof. Mark Braverman. I now work at Google Research New York City in the [https://ai.google/research/teams/algorithms-optimization/ Algorithms and Optimization group]. At a broad level, I am interested in problems in the overlap of algorithms, game theory, and learning. More specifically, my research interests include bandit algorithms, online learning, and algorithmic mechanism design.
