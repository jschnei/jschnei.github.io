== About me
Hello! I am a research scientist at Google Research NYC in the [https://ai.google/research/teams/algorithms-optimization/ Algorithms and Optimization group]. Before this, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Princeton University under the supervision of Prof. Mark Braverman. 

My current research interests include online learning, game theory, contract design, and convex geometry/optimization. I am especially interested in questions in the overlap between game theory and online learning: what learning algorithms should you play in repeated games? What is your best response if you know your opponent is running (a specific class of) learning algorithm?
